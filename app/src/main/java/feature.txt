I added 3 new navigation menu bars that call the local car database and retrieve the values
from it to get the answers and represent the answer in a toast

The new features can update the answer when new information is added
or retrieving the old data that was saved in the app
when the app is destroyed and then created again

The new menu bars are Total Cars, Total Cost and Average Cost
Total Cars gets all the cars in the application from the local database
Total Cost gets the total cost of all the cars in the application from the local database
Average Cost gets the average cost of all the cars in the application from the local database
